### Structure:
* ./source: analysis code
* ./build: compilation
* ./run: run folder

make
# Sometimes the 'make' may be failed, just *repeat make* it again (a known issue for cmake packages?).
```

### How to run
```bash
cd run
./test_run.sh input.list
```
* Check the cutflow under /cutflow
* Check your results under /output
