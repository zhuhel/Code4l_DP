  /// \brief the list of all container names we put into the event
  ///
  /// This is meant to be used in several places:
  ///  - The output tool can use this to determine which containers it
  ///    has to write out
  ///  - If this structure is written out as part of the xAOD
  ///    meta-data, the user can use it to determine the content of a
  ///    file when reading it back, i.e. which object types and
  ///    systematics are contained and what containers to retrieve for
  ///    each.
  ///  - In a similar manner to reading a fully corrected xAOD file,
  ///    this would also allow users to run QuickAna in one algorithm
  ///    and then retrieve the QuickAna output from another algorithm.
  ///
  /// The interface here is probably going to change: For one thing I
  /// want to phase out the ObjectType enum, so this will have to be
  /// changed from ObjectType to string at some point in the future.
  /// For another, it might be nice to provide a retrieve function as
  /// well.  Also, I probably need some functions to check which
  /// containers and systematics are actually defined.  And there may
  /// be some changes as well to make this consistent with how xAOD
  /// meta-data is used.
  ///
  /// For now this is just bolted on to the rest of the QuickAna
  /// implementation, but the hope is that I can eventually integrate
  /// this more closely into the rest of the implementation, which may
  /// require some further changes.
